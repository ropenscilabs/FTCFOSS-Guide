    "text": "Community-Driven Open Source:Enabling First-Time Contributors to Open Source Projects\nOver the last decade, rOpenSci has played a pivotal role in diversifying the open research software community by integrating new developers from underrepresented communities and transforming newcomers into regular contributors to our federation of scientific software via various engagement channels.\nTo further this work, in 2024 we proposed to pilot a new program designed to support sustainability for scientific software packages by recruiting and mentoring contributors and co-maintainers, using community calls and coworking sessions (mini-hackathons and mini-translathons) to provide a structured yet flexible environment to onboard new participants to open-source projects in real-time.\nThis book presents the lessons learned and the organization details of these events. While instructions and notes are presented within an rOpenSci context, we hope that they are clear enough that they could be adapted as a model for use in other organizations. The format has been designed to be scalable across our federation of scientific open source software and we hope will serve as a model for maintainers to replicate in recruiting contributors and co-maintainers.\nIf you find any errors or things that need clarification, we would be grateful if you opened an issue or pull request in the repository for this book.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 United States License.\nThis work was supported by a NumFOCUS Small Development Grant to rOpenSci.",

    "text": "2.1 Summary Comparision\nMaking your first contribution to Open Source can be both empowering and yet very intimidating. Therefore, to encourage and empower contributors, we created a new type of community event which supports specifically first-time contributors to open source software and translation projects. Our goal was to create an inclusive and supportive environment, which would result in a positive learning experience and empower participants to continue contributing.\nWe designed and piloted this new community event format based on pairing community calls to introduce the topics, and specialized hands-on coworking sessions (mini-translathons and mini-hackathons) to give opportunities for participation.\nrOpenSci Community Calls are 1-hour online events with 2-5 speakers, 1 moderator, and include 20-40 minutes of discussion/Q&A. These calls serve to strengthen connections between members of the rOpenSci community, teach technical and social topics, bring different stakeholders’ perspectives to light, and identify unmet needs on a topic. Video, transcripts, notes and summaries of all our calls are published. We have hosted over 40 calls over the last 10 years and attract a global audience with representation from academia, government, non-profit, and industry. We have also started holding these events in Spanish (as of 2023) and Portuguese (as of 2024) to expand global accessibility.\nCoworking sessions are informal, online, gatherings held once a month in rotating timezones. Each session features a different theme and Community Host with expertise in that theme, facilitated by rOpenSci staff.  At these events, participants meet other scientific software developers and experts, cowork on their own projects, and/or ask questions and receive guidance as they work. After each session we publish shared notes and resources. We have hosted over 40 sessions since 2021.\nThis book presents the experiences we learned through our pilot events, an overview of how to run these kinds of events, and specific details on how to run the community calls, mini-translathons, and mini-hackathons. In the Appendices we share examples and templates useful for running these events.\nWe hope this book will inspire and empower you to run your own events to support first-time contributors to open source software and translation projects.",

    "text": "3.1 Feedback\nIn 2024/2025 we hosted two sets of paired events to suppport first time contributors to open source software.\nThe first set of events were designed to support first-time contributors to open source translation projects, using rOpenSci’s Portugese translation projects as an example. To this end, in November 2024 we hosted a Portugese Community Call (A comunidade R fala português) followed by a mini-translathon at LatinR.\nThe second set of events were designed to support first-time contributors to open source R packages. In Januaray 2025 we hosted an English Community Call (From Novice to Contributor: Making and Supporting First-Time Contributions to FOSS), followed by two mini-hackathon coworking sessions in Februrary and March.\nIn this chapter we will discuss some of the feedback and lessons learned from this first set of events. To learn more about organizing these events, see the following chapters.\nAs part of each hands-on mini-translathon or mini-hackathon, participants completed an optional feedback survey collecting insights on their experiences, what they enjoyed and suggestions for improvement.",

    "text": "3.1.1 Translathons\nAs part of the translation efforts, we organized a mini-hackathon focused on reviewing existing Portuguese translations and introducing participants to the review workflow. The event was divided into two main parts: a walkthrough of the translation review process and hands-on sessions where participants practiced doing reviews.\nParticipants expressed that they enjoyed the opportunity to contribute and valued the chance to learn more about using GitHub. Many highlighted that learning the review process helped them contribute to this project and gave them skills and ideas they plan to apply in other open-source and localization projects. There was a suggestion to support other R-related translation projects.\nMost participants also mentioned that organizing this event in collaboration with the LatinR Conference was especially meaningful. It created a space to collaborate with others across the region and contribute to something that brings value to the broader Latin American community.\nOne key suggestion that emerged was the importance of documenting shared agreements—especially on how to translate technical terms consistently. Having a reference guide or glossary would support current and future contributors in maintaining coherence across translations.\nThe enthusiasm sparked during the hackathon continued after the event, with several participants actively engaging in translation and review work in Slack and GitHub. Their commitment and motivation reflect the impact of creating inclusive, hands-on spaces for collaboration and learning.\n\n\n3.1.2 Mini-hackathons\nBriefly, mini-hackathon coworking sessions were designed as an online event with mentors and participants. We started with introductions, then had two periods for coworking separated by a break. During coworking, we had breakout rooms to discuss different topics, and ask questions. For more details, see the Chapter on Mini-hackathons.\nIn summary, participants reported that they appreciated the mentorship & support, learning opportunities, social aspects, and organization of the event. One particpant suggested we conduct more hackathons during our regularly scheduled coworking sessions.\nSpecifically, participants enjoyed\n\nhaving direct mentorship during the process (with many mentors),\nhaving the opportunity to listen to the questions asked by others,\nlearning about the contribution process\nfinishing a Pull Request\nmeeting people from different countries,\nhaving support in multiple languages,\nthe friendly atmosphere\nthe way the coworking session was organized and scheduled\nthe use of breakout rooms\n\nParticipants were also asked for suggestions for improvement. In summary, they suggested having more issues/tasks, more language opportunities, better organization of issues/tasks with respect to the experience and setup required to complete them, and finally, more training materials to help participants get started.\nSpecifically, participants suggested\n\nMore issues to address\nMaking aspects of the introduction bilingual to ensure everyone understands the instructions\nHosting topic or domain-specific events to tap into enthousiastic users in these fields (similar to translathosn)\nPartnering with other organizations involved in specific domains which could host parallel sessions\nIncluding more detailed material on the steps required to make and test a contribution\nConsidering what build tools participants might need to be familiar with to execute certain tasks\nProviding training material/opportunities before the sessions which would cover build tools\nHelping maintainers consider the complexity of tasks they recommend for this event\n\nhow many files need to be changed, and whether or not code needs to be run/built\nwhich tasks are more/less suitable for different types of participant experiences",

    "section": "3.2 Takeaways / Future ideas",
    "text": "3.2 Takeaways / Future ideas\nBased on the official feedback and the trends and details organizers observed themselves during the events, we have some general takeaways and ideas for future events.\n\n3.2.1 Translathons\nFor the translathons one of the suggestion was to organize events focused on translating resources into more languages. Before expanding to more languages, our priority is to consolidate our work in Spanish and Portuguese. We will continue improving and maintaining translations in these two languages to ensure quality and consistency.\nWe plan to organize more translathons, ideally in collaboration with other R community initiatives. Working together will allow us to share a common glossary and community language agreements, strengthening the overall translation effort. Organizing these events alongside other conferences or with communities like R-Ladies chapters or other R User Groups could help broaden participation.\nHaving the GitHub project listing Pull Requests which needed translation work (labelled by translation status) was very helpful to organize how participants chose what to work on, but even with this tool, some people accidentally started working on PRs already in use by another. This signalled to us that we need to be more clear on the process of assigning a PR to a reviewer.\nAfter the event, contributors often continue their work asynchronously, supported by ongoing discussions and updates in our Slack multilingual channel, where people share progress, ask questions, and collaborate. To support ongoing work, we’re considering regular traslathon meetings at a fixed time where people can join to learn, collaborate, and contribute to active translation projects.\n\n\n3.2.2 Mini-hackathons\nFor the mini-hackathons, while we had originally expected to have many participants new to GitHub, in reality most participants were familiar with GitHub in general, but were unfamiliar with collaborating on GitHub. They knew how to make and push commits, but wanted to learn how to make Pull Requests and how that process worked. They were also interested in understanding the etiquette and workflow of making contributions.\nFurther, many participants were very familiar with coding in R (or other programming languages), but were not familiar with R package development (i.e. working with the package structure, using development tools, testing interactively, and using formal unit tests).\nAdding breakout room topics such as “build tools in R” and “collaborating on GitHub” could be a simple way to help participants get support on these topics. Developing a simple “Getting started” guide or workshop to share with participants before the event could be another method for participants who prefer to have a more formal set of instructions.\nIt took time for participants to decide on an issue, and there was the sense sometimes that they felt a bit rushed. If possible, it might therefore be nice to share the GitHub Issues Project Board with participatns before the start of coworking, so they have more time to explore the issues and think about what they would like to tackle.\nAs suggested by one participant, it could also be interesting to try organizing these events with other groups for domain-specific software. This could help build capacity in specific domains and strengthen ties among communities.\nrOpenSci staff also had suggestions, such as to consider using mini-hackathons to support/encourage/find new maintainers for rOpenSci packages, to invite Champions to attend, and to explore collaborations with other organizations.\nAll in all, these mini-hackathons were well received and the helpful feedback submitted indicates that participants are engaged and want to help improve and refine the format.",

Plan a community call to provide guidance on how to get started with translation contributions and different translations and localization efforts that exist for a human language in the community. rOpenSci staff prepare the event by identifying materials in need of translation or review, creating and labeling pull requests for participants to work on, and setting up a GitHub Project board to track progress. During the event, after a brief introduction on how the event is structured and how the translation process works, participants select a pull request to work on. Mentors and editors provide real-time support in breakout rooms or the main room. All contributors are also added to the multilingual channel in the rOpenSci Slack, where they can continue discussing and refining translations after the event.\nDuring and after the event, participants are invited to complete an optional feedback survey collecting insights on their experiences, challenges faced, and suggestions for improvement.",

They help participants get started, troubleshoot issues, and guide them through the workflow.\nEditors: experienced translators responsible for reviewing and maintaining the quality and consistency of translations. Editors check terminology, style, and adherence to the community’s translation agreements.\n\nMentors and Editors sign up to participate beforehand and review the translation process and rules, and the translations that need contributions. They are preferably people who have already contributed, as reviewers or editors, to rOpenSci’s translations and know how the tools used in the process work and are also aware of the translation agreements for the language involved (for example, the Spanish agreements)\nBecause preparing and reviewing translations requires additional effort, we suggest offering mentors and editors an honorarium to recognize their time and contributions.\n\nIn our 2024 pilot, the translathon was hosted in Portuguese in conjunction with LatinR, where many members of the Latin American R community gathered. We focused on translating one resource: rOpenSci Packages: Development, Maintenance, and Peer Review. NumFocus provided the funding to pay mentors and editors a $200 USD honorarium for participating in the translathon.",

For niche events (e.g., by language or subject area), it may be more effective to coordinate with editors and mentors first and then set the date, similar to the dynamics of Community Calls. If you plan to organize multiple events, it is essential to take time zones into account to facilitate global and diverse participation.\n\nIn our pilot case, the translathon was held as a satellite event of the LatinR conference. The conference offered us two potential days and we offered those days with time slots to mentors and editors to set the final date.\n\n\n\n6.4.2 Registration\nRegistration is required for mentors/editors so we can confirm sufficient support and send them preparation instructions. For participants, registration can be optional, especially if the event is not part of a larger event.\n\nIn our pilot we registered attendees free of charge using the same conference registration system (Eventbrite). This system was also used to send pre-event notifications and to share access information for the online meeting which helps with the logistics of the event.\n\n\n\n6.4.3 GitHub Project\nrOpenSci translations are carried out using GitHub projects. Each translation Pull Request is listed in differents cards according to their status:\n\nTodo - Automatic Translation\nTodo - First Review\nTodo - Second Review\nTo be merged\nMerged\n\nEnsure the different projects are up-to-date for the mini translathons. Usually the PR listed under Todo - First Review and Todo - Second Review are the best ones to work on during translathons.\nrOpenSci staff create pull requests with the first automatic translation for the texts needing translation and label them with the corresponding translation tag and event-specific tag (e.g., ro-translathon-2024).\n\ntranslation :mate: is the label used for Spanish translations Tradução is the label used for Portuguese translations.\n\nTranslation tasks should be:\n\nrelatively small (a blog post, a section of documentation, a tutorial, a chapter),\nclearly scoped,\nand already prepared in a pull request to reduce setup time.\n\nTasks can be categorized by:\n\nDocumentation (manuals, guides, books)\nWebsite (pages, posts)\nInterfaces (package messages, Web UI strings)\nTutorials (examples, lessons)\n\nEditors review translations during or after the event, ensuring contributions maintain quality.",

    "text": "7.1 Overview\nMini-hackathons are 2-hr events designed as a variation on the standard rOpenSci coworking format. They are a combination of a hackathon (a dedicated period of time where participants make contributions to selected FOSS projects) and an rOpenSci coworking event (an online video meeting where participants come together to work on different things and socialize).\nrOpenSci Coworking Sessions are generally 2-hr sessions with a primary host and a guest community host with a different theme each month. During a session, the primary host orientates participants and leads introductions. Then participants can choose work on their own projects, to socialize or discuss the monthly theme in a ‘noisy’ breakout room with the community host, or a combination of the two. The primary host arranges a break and mini-scavenger hunt in the middle and wraps up the meeting at the end.\nMini-hackathons differ from coworking (and from many hackathons) in that it is presumed that most if not all participants are attending to contribute to FOSS (possibly for the first time), there are many breakout rooms, and there are at least 5-10 mentors or maintainers to support the participants.\nIn a mini-hackathon, rOpenSci staff, package maintainers, and mentors are on hand to support participants with their first contributions. Maintainers and mentors sign up to participate beforehand and prepare relevant issues for new contributors. During the coworking session, mentors and maintainers split into different Zoom breakout rooms to chat with participants one-on-one or in small groups to support them with their contributions. All maintainers, mentors, and participants are also added to a special mini-hackathon channel in the rOpenSci Slack where they can further discuss contributions after the event ends.\nDuring and after the event, participants are invited to complete an optional feedback survey collecting insights on their experiences, challenges faced, and suggestions for improvement.",

    "section": "7.2 Maintainers and Mentors",
    "text": "7.2 Maintainers and Mentors\nThe goal of mini-hackathons is less that open source projects receive attention, and more that participants have a good experience from which they learn how to make contributions, and gain the confidence/motivation to continue making contributions. Therefore, the core idea of the mini-hackathon is that it is a live and synchronous event, and that there will be active and immediate support for participants.\nAs such it is important to ensure that sufficient maintainers and mentors are present. Maintainers are those who maintain an R package to which they will be supporting contributions. Mentors are those who are not expliciting supporting contributions to their own R package, but who will be generally helping participants learn how to make contributions to other packages.\n\nOriginally we solicited participation from maintainers of rOpenSci packages in particular, later however, we opened up registration to maintainers of any R package and mentors in general in order to increase the number of maintainers and mentors participating.\n\nBecause this work doesn’t necessarily directly benefit the maintainer or mentor, and for maintainers it may require extra work to prepare an R package for contributions of this nature, we suggest offering maintainers and mentors an honorarium to help equalize participation by offsetting the cost of their time. If you do, prepare clear instructions on how mentors can receive their honorarium after the event. Depending on how your organization works, you may wish to include links to optional invoice templates.\n\nIn our 2024/2025 pilot we applied for and received funding from NumFocus through an Small Development Grant which allowed us to offer maintainers and mentors a $200 USD honorarium for participating in the mini-hackathons.",

    "section": "7.4 Planning",
    "text": "7.4 Planning\n\n7.4.1 Set the date of the event\nPick dates for the events prior to advertising open calls for maintainers and mentors and participants. Make sure you give yourself enough time to recruit maintainers and mentors (~6-8 weeks) and to change the date if you feel that you may not have enough maintainers and mentors. Then once you have a good set of maintainers and mentors registered, start advertizing for general participants (~4-6 weeks).\nHowever, if conducting domain-specific events, then it could be worth contacting maintainers and mentors first and then picking dates with their schedules in mind (similar to how rOpenSci organizes Community Calls).\n\nIn our pilot we had opened the call for mentors before setting a date. We then used a poll to decide on appropriate dates for the mini-hackathon. This made it difficult for mentors to commit to the event, as we were asking for expressions of interest before we had a date.\n\nRegardless of how dates are set, if arranging several events, choose times which give a reasonable level of international coverage.\n\nIn our pilot, we had two events, and so chose European and Australian time zones to cover as much range as possible.\n\n\n\n7.4.2 Registration\nRegistration is required for maintainers and mentors as we need to ensure there we have enough to help, and we need a way of contacting them to send out further instructions.\nRegistration is optional for participants to encourage last minute attendance, while still giving us an idea of the level of interest in the event. This helps us ensure we have enough maintainers and mentors and makes it easier to send Slack invitations as we already have the emails of some participants. We also pre-populate the coworking documents with the names of maintainers and mentors as well as registered participants.\n\nIn our first mini-hackathon pilot we made registration mandatory for participants, but in the end we didn’t find it necessary, so for the second event we made registration optional.\n\nWe find that optional registration simplifies organizing the event as we dodn’t necessarily have to send out meeting links or deal with last minute registrants.\nHowever, by having mandatory registration you would have an even better idea of the number of participants to expect, so the trade offs may be worth it for your organization, or depending on the nature of your hackathon.\n\nWe used AirTable forms to collect registrations for maintainers and mentors as well as participants. However, any registration form system could work for this step (e.g., Google Forms, Zoom, etc.)\n\n\n\n7.4.3 Issues and Labelling\nAbout two weeks before the event we contact maintainers to remind them about the event and ask them to prepare and label issues in their repositories using a label specific to the event.\nThere are also other labels that are very useful, like ‘help wanted’ and ‘good first issue’. You can also encourage maintainers to consider different type of label according to the type of project.\n\nIn the 2025 mini-hackathons, we used ro-hackathon-2025 as the label and Slack channel name.\n\nWe also suggest that maintainers create certain types of issues for these events. We find that small, bite-sized, coding-related tasks are issues most likely to be tackled by participants.\nExamples include\n\nadding simple tests to improve code coverage\nadding checks to input arguments to existing functions\nfixing problems with best-practices\nupdating use of deprecated functions\nadding badges to READMEs\n\n\nIn our pilot hackathons, participants also pointed out that when thinking about task complexity, maintainers should consider the number of files which need to be modified as well as whether or not any files need to be compiled or the package needs to be re-built.\n\nWhile documentation is something that can be completed by first-time contributors, it doesn’t seem to be as attractive. Possibly because updating usage or creating tutorials requires more time to understand the package, or because it doesn’t give participants a chance to develop the skills they really want to develop.\n\n\n7.4.4 GitHub Project Board\nBy havinging maintainers use a specific label for issues, we can use a GitHub search to identify these issues.\nWe then also find it useful to manually organize these issues into a GitHub Project. This allows us to categorize the issues by type (Documentation, Feature, Best Practices, Testing, etc.) to help participants more quickly find an issue they would like to address. The links to the Project and the Search are added to the Coworking document as well as the Slack channel for easy access.\n\n\n7.4.5 Outreach and Communication\nWe advertise the calls for maintainers and mentors and participants with\n\nblog posts (e.g., mentors, participants)\nsocial media (e.g., LinkedIn and Mastodon; see example text),\nSlack channels (rOpenSci as well as on partnering Slack workspaces)\nrOpenSci Newsletter (e.g., mentors, participants).\n\nIn addition the these announcements, it’s important to send reminders 1 week, 1 day, and 1 hour in advance on social media (examples).",

In this way the attendees can begin to decide what they would like to work on and with whom.\nDuring coworking, we open breakout rooms to cover different topics. We include a Quiet room where people can work without chatter, as well as several generic rooms (“Room 1”, etc.) where package maintainers can chat one-on-one or with small groups of participants about their package.\nAt the start of coworking an organizer asks mentors (those without a package), to go to a topic room and stay for 5 min in case a participant would like help with that topic. Afterwards they are free to ‘roam’ and see where they might assist participants or maintainers.\nNext an organizer will ask participants if they have a particular package or issue they’d like to work on, and will help match participants up with maintainers if they are unsure. The organizer will assign maintainers to specific rooms to chat with participants as participants express interest.\nAfter this initial sorting, at least one organizer remains in the ‘main’ room to help direct participants.\n\n\nBreakout room topics\n\nGeneral (main room) ‘If you’re not sure, come here’\nCollaboration Workflows and Etiquette\nCollaborating on GitHub (Pull Requests)\nBuild tools for R packages\nTranslations\nQuiet Room\nRoom 1\nRoom 2\n…\n\n\nIn our pilot mini-hackathons, we had one ‘Git and GitHub’ room rather than the two ‘Collaborating’ rooms, but it was rarely used.",

    "text": "B.1.1 Mentors - 2 weeks before\nSubject: rOpenSci Mini-Hackathon - Preparation\nHi Everyone!\nWe’re looking forward to our second Mini-hackathon coworking session in two weeks, March 4th, 13:00–15:00 UTC (find your local time [UPDATE DATE/TIME]). Some of you have signed up as Package Maintainers, and some as Mentors to help guide participants during the hackathon. We’ll send out details of how things will go next week, but in the meantime we wanted to give Package Maintainers some suggestions for preparing.\nBefore the hackathon we ask that Maintainers take a bit of time to create and/or label issues in your packages. We find that small ‘bite-size’ tasks work well, and small coding-related tasks especially so.\nConsider issues for things like adding simple tests (e.g., testing that functions fail correctly), or adding argument checks to an existing function (e.g., ensure that the function fails informatively given incorrect inputs). You can run test coverage on your package to identify lines that need coverage which might be straightforward to address. Another thing that you can consider is addressing problems identified by ‘goodpractice’ (we’d suggest running this beforehand and creating specific issues for the items identified). Updating the README or clarifying the CONTRIBUTING guide are also useful, yet manageable tasks.\nMake sure you use the label “ro-hackathon-YYYY” so we can find it and add the issue to our master list. Also consider labels such as “help wanted” and “good first issue”. There may be participants who have more advanced skills so feel free to label some non-beginner issues as well.\nWe’ve created a channel called “ro-hackathon-YYYY” in the rOpenSci Slack and have added those of you who are already in this Slack. If you are not in our workspace, you will get an invitation from Yani nearer to the event.\nFeel free to advertise this event [UPDATE LINK] in your circles or social media!\nLet us know if you have any questions or would like any help or feedback on anything,\nYani Bellini Saibene\nCommunity Manager, rOpenSci\nSteffi LaZerte\nCommunity Manager Assistant\n\n\nB.1.2 Mentors - 1 week before\nSubject: rOpenSci Mini-Hackathon - Information\nHi Everyone!\nWe’re looking forward to our second Mini-hackathon coworking session next week, MONTH DAYth, HH:MM–HH:MM UTC (find your local time [UPDATE DATE/TIME]). This will be on Zoom (details on the event page [UPDATE LINK] and below) and Yani and Steffi will be available to help out.\nBefore the hackathon\nAs a reminder, we ask that Maintainers take a bit of time before the event to create and/or label issues in your packages. Remember to use the “ro-hackathon-2025” label and let us know if you have any questions or need any help with this.\nDuring the hackathon\nWe will do a brief introduction and ask Maintainers and Mentors to introduce themselves.. Once we get started we will ask Mentors to hang out in specific topic breakout rooms (e.g., “git/GitHub”) for at least the first 5 min to see if any participants would like to chat. After that they are free to roam about the rooms, helping as they like. Maintainers can claim a breakout room to chat with participants wanting to work on their package or can move about among the rooms. Participants may need some time to get oriented with what tasks are available and how to start working on them. Remember that some participants may be raw beginners, so help them find an appropriate issue to tackle and be encouraging and patient. This will be a coworking session, so people can dive in with getting started but still have others around to help or answer questions.\nAfter the hackathon\nEveryone who participated in the hackathon will be added to a special Slack channel so conversations can continue asynchronously. We suspect that some participants may not finish all they hope to do during the coworking session itself, so we hope that both Maintainers and Mentors will have some availability to answer questions that may come up on the Slack channel in the week following the event (Yani and Steffi will be available too). Yani will also contact you regarding your stipend to help offset the costs of your time for this amazing work!\nWe’re looking forward to seeing you next week, let us know if you have any questions!\nYani Bellini Saibene\nCommunity Manager, rOpenSci\nSteffi LaZerte\nCommunity Manager Assistant\nZoom info:\nLink:\nMeeting ID:\nPasscode:\n\n\nB.1.3 Participants - 2-3 days before\nSubject: rOpenSci Mini-Hackathon - Information\nHi Everyone!\nWe’re looking forward to our second Mini-hackathon coworking session next week, March 4th, 13:00–15:00 UTC (find your local time [UPDATE DATE/TIME]; Zoom details on the event page [UPDATE LINK] and below). We just wanted to check in and give you an overview of how things will go.\nBefore the hackathon\nMost of our packages are on GitHub, so you need to have a GitHub user account.\nDuring the hackathon\nWe will have a list of issues prepared by package maintainers and other experienced mentors available to help guide you. You may want to ask Maintainers to explain details of an issue or package, or you may want to ask any of the Mentors about the basics of git and GitHub (see also Developing Software Together and Happy Git and GitHub for the useR if you’d like to get a head start). This will be a coworking session, so you can dive in with getting started on making a contribution, but still have others around to help or answer questions.\nAfter the hackathon\nEveryone who participated in the hackathon will be added to a special Slack channel so conversations can continue asynchronously.

Therefore we’re exited to announce a special series of activities to support first-time contributors to rOpenSci packages! :tada:\nIn 2025[UPDATE], we’re planning a Community Call and several Coworking sessions/mini hackathons to support first-time contributors.\nAs part of these sessions, we’re looking for rOpenSci package maintainers interested in helping people make their first(ish) contribution to Open Source. We know that maintaining a package requires a lot of time and effort, and teaching and mentoring someone through their first contribution can also take time. So we’re also excited to announce that we have funding to offer participating maintainers a stipend to help offset their time.\nSee our blog post[UPDATE LINK] for more details and how to sign up!",
