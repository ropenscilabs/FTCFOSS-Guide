title: "Community Call"
---

rOpenSci [Community Calls](https://ropensci.org/commcalls) are Zoom calls held several times a year featuring a panel of speakers on a specific topic with a significant Question & Answer period.
Calls cover a variety of topics, from technical (["A Journey through Arrow in R"](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/jun2023-arrow/))
to community (["Set Up Your Package to Foster a Community"](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/apr2021-pkg-community/)). 
Most topics are in English, but we are introducing Calls in Spanish (["Proyecto Multilingüe"](https://ropensci.org/es/commcalls/nov2023-multilenguaje/)) as well
as in Portugese(["A comunidade R fala português"](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/translation-portuguese/), part of this Pilot)]. 

For general organizing, see our blog post ["How rOpenSci Runs Community Calls"](https://ropensci.org/blog/2021/02/02/ropensci-community-calls/) as well
as our ["Checklist for a Community Call"](https://github.com/ropensci-org/community-calls/blob/master/checklist.md). 

In this chapter we will address the specifics of running a Community Call to 
support first time contributors to open source software.

<!-- Yani, I would suggest only adding things here which are specific to this 
project. Anything that is a general Community Call organization thing and which
is covered in the above links I think you can either omit, or simply refer to the
above links. No need to 'reinvent the wheel' ;)  -->
