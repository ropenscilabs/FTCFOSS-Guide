## Slack - Maintainers announcement

Hi @channel

Making your first contribution to Open Source can be both empowering and intimidating.
Therefore weâ€™re exited to announce a special series of activities to support first-time contributors to rOpenSci packages! :tada:

In **2025**, we're planning a Community Call and several Coworking sessions/mini hackathons to support first-time contributors.

As part of these sessions, we're looking for rOpenSci package maintainers interested in helping people make their first(ish) contribution to Open Source.
We know that maintaining a package requires a lot of time and effort, and teaching and mentoring someone through their first contribution can also take time. So we're also excited to announce that we have funding to offer participating maintainers a stipend to help offset their time.

See our [blog post](https://ropensci.org/events/coworking-2025-03/)[UPDATE LINK] for more details and how to sign up!

We're hoping to get enough maintainers registered by this Sunday (Nov 24th) so we can start the ball rolling finding times that work for everyone in 2025.

If you've been thinking about it, here's a mini push to register ðŸ˜„

Also regarding Supporting First Time Contributions...

If you're interested in participating but don't have an rOpenSci package, or are interested in having people make contributions to your package but don't have time to join the coworking sessions, we also encourage you to register and let us know in the comments. We'll see if we can't come up with some pairings that work for all. Thanks everyone!
