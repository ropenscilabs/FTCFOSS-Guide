## Registration for mentors

**Call for rOpenSci Maintainers to Support First-Time Contributors**

Welcome! We are looking for maintainers of rOpenSci packages or R packages maintainers to participate in coworking events designed to support people making first-time contributions. If you are interested in participating please fill out this form. Please contact Yani or Steffi if you have any questions, or check out the blog post announcement (ADD BLOG POST LINK).

Then, if participating, we ask that maintainers:

- Work with rOpenSci staff to pick dates/times for the coworking events which best work for everyone.
- Create and/or identify issues in your rOpenSci repository as ‘Help wanted’ and ‘Good first issue’.
- These can range from documentation to coding changes. We just ask that some issues are relatively accessible to contributors with less experience.
- Attend one of the Coworking sessions to be available to offer advice or answer questions.
- Have some availability before and after the Coworking event to respond via GitHub and Slack to issues, comments, or PRs which may arise from contributors outside of the two-hour coworking slot.

If you participate, you can also expect that:

- We will connect with you before the events to find a date/time for the coworking sessions and see if you have any questions regarding issue-labelling or the coworking sessions.
- We will be available to support you during the Coworking sessions on Zoom, as well as on GitHub, Slack, or by email before and after.
- You will receive a $XXX USD stipend to help offset the time you spend teaching and mentoring these new contributors.
