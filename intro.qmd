# Introduction


## Background
In 2024/2025, rOpenSci piloted a new community event format for connecting new contributors to open-source scientific software and documentation translation. This event format involves pairing community calls and specialized coworking sessions with goal of guiding community members into first-time contributions to open source scientific software and translation projects through an inclusive and supportive learning experience. 

This new format was an extension of our successful and established [community call](https://ropensci.org/commcalls) and [coworking](https://ropensci.org/coworking) activities.

rOpenSci **Community Calls** are 1-hour online events with 2-5 speakers, 1 moderator, and include 20-40 minutes of discussion/Q&A.
These calls serve to strengthen connections between members of the rOpenSci community, teach technical and social topics, bring different stakeholders’ perspectives to light, and identify unmet needs on a topic.
Video, transcripts, notes and summaries of all our calls are published.
We have hosted 43 calls with XX unique presenters attended by more than xx people from xx countries. 
We attract a global audience with representation from academia, government, non-profit, and industry.
In the past year we have started holding these events in Spanish and Portuguese to expand global accessibility.

We introduced **Coworking** sessions in 2021.
These sessions give our members the opportunity to cowork on open-source projects with common themes.
Each session features a different Community Host with expertise in the theme, facilitated by rOpenSci staff. 
At these events, participants meet other scientific software developers and experts, and ask questions and receive guidance as they work.
After each session we publish shared notes and resources.
To date, we have hosted XX sessions. 

## Pilot

<!-- TODO: Yani, do you think we should move the Pilot and included sections here to their own Chapter? -->

In 2024/2025 we hosted two sets of paired events to suppport first time contributors to open source software.
We used community calls to introduce the topics and hands-on coworking sessions to give opportunities for  participation.
This format is designed to be scalable across our federation of scientific OSS and will serve as a model for maintainers to replicate in recruiting contributors and co-maintainers.

The first set of events were designed to support first-time contributors to open source Translation projects, using rOpenSci's Portugese translation projects as an example.
To this end, in November 2025 we hosted a Portugese Community Call ([A comunidade R fala português](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/translation-portuguese/)) followed by a [mini-translathon at LatinR](https://latinr.org/en/cronograma/translaton/translaton-en.html).

The second set of events were designed to support first-time contributors to open source R packages. 
In Januaray 2025 we hosted an English Community Call ([From Novice to Contributor: Making and Supporting First-Time Contributions to FOSS](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/first-time-contributor/)), 
followed by two mini-hackathon coworking sessions in [Februrary](https://ropensci.org/events/coworking-2025-02/) and [March](https://ropensci.org/events/coworking-2025-03/). 

In this guide we share resources to help plan and host more of these events as well as lessons learned. 

### Feedback

As part of each hands-on mini-hackathon or translation, 
participants completed an optional feedback survey collecting insights on their experiences, 
challenges faced, and suggestions for improvement.

### Takeaways
In addition to the official feedback provided, the organizers also picked up on some trends and details during the events. 

For the **translathons**...

For the **mini-hackathons**, while we had originally expected to have many participants new to GitHub, 
in reality most participants were familiar with GitHub in general, but were unfamiliar with *collaborating* on GitHub. 
They knew how to make and push commits, but wanted to learn how to make Pull Requests and how that process worked. 
They were also interested in understanding the etiquette and workflow of making contributions.

Further, many participants were very familiar with coding in R (or other programming languages), 
but were not familiar with R package development (i.e. working with the package structure, using development tools, testing interactively, and using formal unit tests). 

It took time for participants to decide on an issue,
and there was the sense sometimes that they felt a bit rushed. 
If possible, it might therefore be nice to share the GitHub Issues Project Board with participatns *before* the start of coworking, so they have more time to explore the issues and think about what they would like to tackle.
