# Introduction


## Background
In 2024/2025, rOpenSci piloted a new community event format for connecting new contributors to open-source scientific software and documentation translation. This event format involves pairing community calls and specialized coworking sessions with goal of guiding community members into first-time contributions to open source scientific software and translation projects through an inclusive and supportive learning experience. 

This new format was an extension of our successful and established [community call](https://ropensci.org/commcalls) and [coworking](https://ropensci.org/coworking) activities.

rOpenSci **Community Calls** are 1-hour online events with 2-5 speakers, 1 moderator, and include 20-40 minutes of discussion/Q&A.
These calls serve to strengthen connections between members of the rOpenSci community, teach technical and social topics, bring different stakeholders’ perspectives to light, and identify unmet needs on a topic.
Video, transcripts, notes and summaries of all our calls are published.
We have hosted 43 calls with XX unique presenters attended by more than xx people from xx countries. 
We attract a global audience with representation from academia, government, non-profit, and industry.
In the past year we have started holding these events in Spanish and Portuguese to expand global accessibility.

We introduced **Coworking** sessions in 2021.
These sessions give our members the opportunity to cowork on open-source projects with common themes.
Each session features a different Community Host with expertise in the theme, facilitated by rOpenSci staff. 
At these events, participants meet other scientific software developers and experts, and ask questions and receive guidance as they work.
After each session we publish shared notes and resources.
To date, we have hosted XX sessions. 

## Pilot

In 2024/2025 we hosted two sets of paired events to suppport first time contributors to open source software.
We used community calls to introduce the topics and hands-on coworking sessions to give opportunities for  participation.
This format is designed to be scalable across our federation of scientific OSS and will serve as a model for maintainers to replicate in recruiting contributors and co-maintainers.

The first set of events were designed to support first-time contributors to open source Translation projects, using rOpenSci's Portugese translation projects as an example.
To this end, in November 2025 we hosted a Portugese Community Call ([A comunidade R fala português](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/translation-portuguese/)) followed by a [mini-translathon at LatinR](https://latinr.org/en/cronograma/translaton/translaton-en.html).

The second set of events were designed to support first-time contributors to open source R packages. 
In Januaray 2025 we hosted an English Community Call ([From Novice to Contributor: Making and Supporting First-Time Contributions to FOSS](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/first-time-contributor/)), 
followed by two mini-hackathon coworking sessions in [Februrary](https://ropensci.org/events/coworking-2025-02/) and [March](https://ropensci.org/events/coworking-2025-03/). 

### Pilot Feedback

As part of each hands-on mini-hackathon or translation, 
participants completed an optional feedback survey collecting insights on their experiences, 
challenges faced, and suggestions for improvement.

In this guide we share resources and lessons learned from hosting these events.
