title: "Mini-hackathon"

## Overview

Mini-hackathons are 2-hr events designed as a variation on the standard rOpenSci coworking format. 
They are a combination of a hackathon (a dedicated period of time where participants make contributions to selected FOSS projects) 
and an rOpenSci coworking event (an online video meeting where participants come together to work on different things and socialize). 

rOpenSci [Coworking Sessions](https://ropensci.org/coworking/) are generally 2-hr sessions with a primary host and a guest community host with a different theme each month.
During a session, the primary host orientates participants and leads introductions.
Then participants can choose work on their own projects, to socialize or discuss the monthly theme in a 'noisy' breakout room with the community host, or a combination of the two.
The primary host arranges a break and mini-scavenger hunt in the middle and wraps up the meeting at the end.

Mini-hackathons differ from coworking (and from many hackathons) in that it is presumed that 
most if not all participants are attending to contribute to FOSS (possibly for the first time),
there are many breakout rooms,
and there are at least 5-10 mentors or maintainers to support the participants. 

In a mini-hackathon, rOpenSci staff, mentors, and package maintainers are on hand to support participants with their first contributions.
Maintainers sign up to participate beforehand and prepare relevant issues for new contributors.
During the coworking session, mentors and maintainers split into different Zoom breakout rooms to chat with participants one-on-one or in small groups to support them with their contributions. 
All maintainers, mentors and participants are also added to a special mini-hackathon channel in the rOpenSci Slack where they can further discuss contributions after the event ends.

## Maintainers / Mentors

The goal of mini-hackathons is less that open source projects receive attention, and more that participants have a good experience from which they learn how to make contributions, and gain the confidence/motivation to continue making contributions. 
Therefore, the core idea of the mini-hackathon is that it is a **live** and **synchronous** event, and that there will be active and immediate support for participants. 

As such it is important to ensure that sufficient maintainers *and* mentors are present. 
**Maintainers** are those who maintain an R package to which they will be supporting contributions. 
**Mentors** are those who are not expliciting supporting contributions to their own R package, but who will be generally helping participants learn how to make contributions to other packages. 

Because this work doesn't necessarily directly benefit the maintainer/mentor and may require extra work to prepare an R package for contributions of this nature, 
**we suggest offering maintainers/mentors an honorarium** to help equalize participation by offsetting the cost of their time.

> In our 2024/2025 pilot we applied received funding from NumFocus 
> to offer Mentors/Maintainers a $200 USD honorarium for participating in the
> mini-hackathons.

> Originally we asked for maintainers of rOpenSci packages in particular, 
> later however, we opened up registration to maintainers of any R package.

## Timeline

See [Events Overview](events-overview.html) for the full timeline of paired 
events.

The timeline is setup for a single event, but repeat events are easy to insert
after the first three tasks.

## Planning

### Choosing dates
In our pilot we had opened the call for mentors before setting a date. 
We then used a poll to decide on appropriate dates for the mini-hackathon. 
This made it difficult for mentors to commit to the event, as we were
asking for expressions of interest before we had a date, so for future, generic events we suggest picking a date first.

<!--TODO: Yani, did we decide that it would be better/easier to set the date before hand?-->
However, if conducting domain-specific events, then it could be worth contacting mentor/maintainers first and then organizing the events in tandem with their schedules (similar to Community Calls). 

Regardless of when dates are set, if arranging several events, 
choose dates which give a reasonable level of international coverage. 

> In our pilot, we had two events, and so chose European and Australian time zones to cover as much time as possible.

### Registration

Registration is required for [maintainers/mentors](templates_forms.html#mentors) as we need to ensure there are enough and we will be 
sending out further instructions.
However, although for our for our first mini-hackathon pilot we made registration mandatory for [participants](templates_forms.html#participants), 
in the end we didn't find it necessary, so for the second event we made registration optional.

By having optional registration we had an idea of numbers, but simplified the process as we didn't
_have_ to send out meeting links or deal with last minute registrants.

We pre-populated the coworking documents with the names of maintainer/mentors as well as registered participation, but other, unregistered participants were invited to add their names to the end. 

> We used AirTable forms to collect registration from [maintainers/mentors](templates_forms.html#mentors)
as well as [participants](templates_forms.html#participants).
> However, any registration form system could work for this step (e.g., Google Forms etc.)

### Good issues and Labelling

About two weeks before the event we [contact maintainers](templates_emails.html#mentors1) to remind them about the event and ask them to prepare and label issues in their repositories using a label specific to the event.

> In the 2025 mini-hackathons, we used `ro-hackathon-2025` as the label and Slack channel name.

In our first mini-hackathon we found that issues most likely to be tackled by participants were
small, bite-sized, coding-related tasks. 

Examples included

- adding simple tests to improve code coverage
- adding checks to input arguments to existing functions
- fixing problems with best-practices
- updating use of deprecated functions
- adding badges to READMEs

While documentation is something that can be completed by first-time contributors, 
it didn't seem to be as attractive.
Possibly because updateing usage or creating tutorials requires more time to understand the package, 
or because it didn't give participants a chance to develop the skills they really wanted to develop.


### GitHub Project Board
By havinging maintainers use a specific label for issues, 
we can use a [GitHub search](https://github.com/search?q=label%3Aro-hackathon-2025&type=issues)
to identify these issues. 

We then also find it useful to manually organize these issues into a [GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/rosadmin/projects/14/views/1). 
This allows us to categorize the issues by type (Documentation, Feature, Best Practices, Testing, etc.) to help participants more quickly find an issue they would like to address.

## Coworking

Here we cover the specifics of actually running the event. 
What needs to be done just before, during, and after the event. 

Note that during coworking, we used a [slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mMeMkt2Vy7B-ablhimxc2voEyqWOcTN-obuIUkgI1cE/edit?usp=sharing) deck and [Coworking Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1juXuCMvz7a9BX_VK6SO4QCs7T78BZDHAs589wHjL3Ug/edit?usp=sharing) for introductions, sharing links, and sharing notes.

### Running the event

#### Schedule {-}

- Introduction (10-15 min)
- Co-working (45 min)
- Break/Checkin (5-10 min) *Mini scavenger hunt*
- Co-working (45 min)
- Wrap up (5 min)

During coworking, we open breakout rooms to cover different topics. 
We included a Quiet room where people could work without chatter, 
as well as several generic rooms ("Room 1", etc.) where package maintainers can chat one-on-one or with small groups of participants about their package.

At the start of coworking an organizer asks mentors (those without a package), 
to go to a topic room and stay for 5min in case a participant would like help with that topic. 
Afterwards they are free to 'roam' and see where they might assist participants or maintainers.

Next an organizer will ask participants if they have a particular package or issue they'd like to work on, 
and will help match participants up with maintainers if they are unsure. 
The organizer will assign maintainers to specific rooms to chat with participants as participants express interest.

After this initial sorting, at least one organizer remains in the 'main' room to help direct participants.

#### Breakout room topics {-}

- General (main room) 'If you’re not sure, come here'
- Collaboration Workflows and Etiquette
- Collaborating on GitHub (Pull Requests)
- Translations
- Quiet Room
- Room 1 
- Room 2
- ...

> In our first mini-hackathons, we had one 'Git and GitHub' room rather than the two 'Collaborating' rooms, but it was [almost never used](intro.html#takeaways).
