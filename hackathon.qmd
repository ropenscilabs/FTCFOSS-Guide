title: "Mini-hackathon"

## Overview

Mini-hackathons are 2-hr events designed as a variation on the standard rOpenSci coworking format. 
They are a combination of a hackathon (where participants come together to make contributions to FOSS) 
and an rOpenSci coworking event. 

rOpenSci [Coworking Sessions](https://ropensci.org/coworking/) are generally 2-hr sessions with a primary host and a guest community host with a different theme each month.
During a session, the primary host orientates participants and leads introductions.
Then participants can choose work on their own projects, to socialize or discuss the monthly theme in a 'noisy' breakout room with the community host, or a combination of the two.
The primary host arranges a break and mini-scavenger hunt in the middle and wraps up the meeting at the end.

Mini-hackathons differ from coworking (and from many hackathons) in that it is presumed that 
most if not all participants are attending to contribute to FOSS (possibly for the first time),
there are many breakout rooms,
and there are at least 5-10 mentors or maintainers to support the participants. 

In a mini-hackathon, rOpenSci staff, mentors, and package maintainers are on hand to support participants with their first contributions.
Maintainers sign up to participate beforehand and prepare relevant issues for new contributors.
During the coworking session, mentors and maintainers split into different Zoom breakout rooms to chat with participants one-on-one or in small groups to support them with their contributions. 
All maintainers, mentors and participants are also added to a special mini-hackathon channel in the rOpenSci Slack where they can further discuss contributions after the event ends.

## Maintainers / Mentors

The goal of mini-hackathons is less that open source projects receive attention, and more that participants have a good experience from which they learn how to make contributions, and gain the confidence/motivation to continue making contributions. 
Therefore, the core idea of the mini-hackathon is that it is a **live** and **synchronous** event, and that there will be active and immediate support for participants. 

As such it is important to ensure that sufficient maintainers *and* mentors are present. 
**Maintainers** are those who maintain an R package to which they will be supporting contributions. 
**Mentors** are those who are not expliciting supporting contributions to their own R package, but who will be generally helping participants learn how to make contributions to other packages. 

Because this work doesn't necessarily directly benefit the maintainer/mentor and may require extra work to prepare an R package for contributions of this nature, 
**we suggest offering maintainers/mentors an honorarium** to help equalize participation by offsetting the cost of their time.

> In our 2024/2025 pilot we applied received funding from NumFocus 
> to offer Mentors/Maintainers a $200 USD honorarium for participating in the
> mini-hackathons.

### Choosing dates
In our pilot we had opened the call for mentors before setting a date. 
We then used a poll to decide on appropriate dates for the mini-hackathon. 
This made it difficult for mentors to commit to the event, as we were
asking for expressions of interest before we had a date, so for future, generic events we suggest picking a date first.

<!--TODO: Yani, did we decide that it would be better/easier to set the date before hand?-->
However, if conducting domain-specific events, then it could be worth contacting mentor/maintainers first and then organizing the events in tandem with their schedules (similar to Community Calls). 

Regardless of when dates are set, if arranging several events, 
choose dates which give a reasonable level of international coverage. 

> In our pilot, we had two events, and so chose European and Australian time zones to cover as much time as possible.

## Details

### Registration

We used AirTable forms to collect registration from [maintainers/mentors](templates_forms.html#mentors)
as well as [participants](templates_forms.html#participants).
Any form system could work for this step.

Registration is required for maintainers/mentors as we need to ensure there are enough and we will be 
sending out further instructions.
However, although for our for our first mini-hackathon pilot, we made registration mandatory, we didn't feel that it was necessary, and for the second we made registration optional.

By having optional registration we had an idea of numbers, but simplified the process as we didn't
_have_ to send out meeting links or deal with last minute registrants.

We pre-populated the coworking documents with the names of maintainer/mentors as well as registered participation, but other, unregistered participants were invited to add their names to the end.
