title: "Coworking Mini-hackathon"
---

## Overview

Participants completed an optional feedback survey collecting insights on their experiences, challenges faced, and suggestions for improvement.

## Community Call
It will provide an overview of software package architecture, contributing guidelines, and outstanding issues.
It will do so in a welcoming environment where authors and potential contributors can share experiences, address common questions, and provide esential resources.
Attendees has the opportunity to ask questions and engage with new and experienced contributors in a supportive atmosphere.

## Mini-Hackathons

Hosted by rOpenSci staff and package maintainers who will be on hand to support participants with their first contributions.
Maintainers sign up to participate beforehand and prepare relevant issues for new contributors.
As we expect the maintainers to go above simple package maintenance and to be supportive mentors and teachers, we will provide an honorarium.
In this pilot we hosted two of these events as multilingual events in English and Spanish.

still be too early/late for those living in
