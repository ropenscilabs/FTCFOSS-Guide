    "text": "2.1 Background\nIn 2024/2025, rOpenSci piloted a new community event format for connecting new contributors to open-source scientific software and documentation translation. This event format involves pairing community calls and specialized coworking sessions with goal of guiding community members into first-time contributions to open source scientific software and translation projects through an inclusive and supportive learning experience.\nThis new format was an extension of our successful and established community call and coworking activities.\nrOpenSci Community Calls are 1-hour online events with 2-5 speakers, 1 moderator, and include 20-40 minutes of discussion/Q&A. These calls serve to strengthen connections between members of the rOpenSci community, teach technical and social topics, bring different stakeholders’ perspectives to light, and identify unmet needs on a topic. Video, transcripts, notes and summaries of all our calls are published. We have hosted 43 calls with XX unique presenters attended by more than xx people from xx countries.  We attract a global audience with representation from academia, government, non-profit, and industry. In the past year we have started holding these events in Spanish and Portuguese to expand global accessibility.\nWe introduced Coworking sessions in 2021. These sessions give our members the opportunity to cowork on open-source projects with common themes. Each session features a different Community Host with expertise in the theme, facilitated by rOpenSci staff.  At these events, participants meet other scientific software developers and experts, and ask questions and receive guidance as they work. After each session we publish shared notes and resources. To date, we have hosted XX sessions.",

    "text": "6.1 Overview\nMini-hackathons are 2-hr events designed as a variation on the standard rOpenSci coworking format. They are a combination of a hackathon (a dedicated period of time where participants make contributions to selected FOSS projects) and an rOpenSci coworking event (an online video meeting where participants come together to work on different things and socialize).\nrOpenSci Coworking Sessions are generally 2-hr sessions with a primary host and a guest community host with a different theme each month. During a session, the primary host orientates participants and leads introductions. Then participants can choose work on their own projects, to socialize or discuss the monthly theme in a ‘noisy’ breakout room with the community host, or a combination of the two. The primary host arranges a break and mini-scavenger hunt in the middle and wraps up the meeting at the end.\nMini-hackathons differ from coworking (and from many hackathons) in that it is presumed that most if not all participants are attending to contribute to FOSS (possibly for the first time), there are many breakout rooms, and there are at least 5-10 mentors or maintainers to support the participants.\nIn a mini-hackathon, rOpenSci staff, mentors, and package maintainers are on hand to support participants with their first contributions. Maintainers sign up to participate beforehand and prepare relevant issues for new contributors. During the coworking session, mentors and maintainers split into different Zoom breakout rooms to chat with participants one-on-one or in small groups to support them with their contributions. All maintainers, mentors and participants are also added to a special mini-hackathon channel in the rOpenSci Slack where they can further discuss contributions after the event ends.",

    "text": "2.2 Pilot\n\nIn 2024/2025 we hosted two sets of paired events to suppport first time contributors to open source software. We used community calls to introduce the topics and hands-on coworking sessions to give opportunities for participation. This format is designed to be scalable across our federation of scientific OSS and will serve as a model for maintainers to replicate in recruiting contributors and co-maintainers.\nThe first set of events were designed to support first-time contributors to open source Translation projects, using rOpenSci’s Portugese translation projects as an example. To this end, in November 2025 we hosted a Portugese Community Call (A comunidade R fala português) followed by a mini-translathon at LatinR.\nThe second set of events were designed to support first-time contributors to open source R packages. In Januaray 2025 we hosted an English Community Call (From Novice to Contributor: Making and Supporting First-Time Contributions to FOSS), followed by two mini-hackathon coworking sessions in Februrary and March.\nIn this guide we share resources to help plan and host more of these events as well as lessons learned.\n\n2.2.1 Feedback\nAs part of each hands-on mini-hackathon or translation, participants completed an optional feedback survey collecting insights on their experiences, challenges faced, and suggestions for improvement.\nTODO: ADD GENERAL, summarized Feedback\n\n\n2.2.2 Takeaways\nIn addition to the official feedback provided, the organizers also picked up on some trends and details during the events.\nFor the translathons…\nFor the mini-hackathons, while we had originally expected to have many participants new to GitHub, in reality most participants were familiar with GitHub in general, but were unfamiliar with collaborating on GitHub. They knew how to make and push commits, but wanted to learn how to make Pull Requests and how that process worked. They were also interested in understanding the etiquette and workflow of making contributions.\nFurther, many participants were very familiar with coding in R (or other programming languages), but were not familiar with R package development (i.e. working with the package structure, using development tools, testing interactively, and using formal unit tests).\nIt took time for participants to decide on an issue, and there was the sense sometimes that they felt a bit rushed. If possible, it might therefore be nice to share the GitHub Issues Project Board with participatns before the start of coworking, so they have more time to explore the issues and think about what they would like to tackle.",

Some of you have signed up as Package Maintainers, and some as Mentors to help guide participants during the hackathon. We’ll send out details of how things will go next week, but in the meantime we wanted to give Package Maintainers some suggestions for preparing.\nBefore the hackathon we ask that Maintainers take a bit of time to create and/or label issues in your packages. We find that small ‘bite-size’ tasks work well, and small coding-related tasks especially so.\nConsider issues for things like adding simple tests (e.g., testing that functions fail correctly), or adding argument checks to an existing function (e.g., ensure that the function fails informatively given incorrect inputs). You can run test coverage on your package to identify lines that need coverage which might be straightforward to address. Another thing that you can consider is addressing problems identified by ‘goodpractice’ (we’d suggest running this beforehand and creating specific issues for the items identified). Updating the README or clarifying the CONTRIBUTING guide are also useful, yet manageable tasks.\nMake sure you use the label “ro-hackathon-YYYY” so we can find it and add the issue to our master list. Also consider labels such as “help wanted” and “good first issue”. There may be participants who have more advanced skills so feel free to label some non-beginner issues as well.\nWe’ve created a channel called “ro-hackathon-YYYY” in the rOpenSci Slack and have added those of you who are already in this Slack. If you are not in our workspace, you will get an invitation from Yani nearer to the event.\nFeel free to advertise this event [UPDATE LINK] in your circles or social media!\nLet us know if you have any questions or would like any help or feedback on anything,\nYani Bellini Saibene\nCommunity Manager, rOpenSci\nSteffi LaZerte\nCommunity Manager Assistant",

This will be on Zoom (details on the event page and below) and Yani and Steffi will be available to help out.\nBefore the hackathon\nAs a reminder, we ask that Maintainers take a bit of time before the event to create and/or label issues in your packages. Remember to use the “ro-hackathon-2025” label and let us know if you have any questions or need any help with this.\nDuring the hackathon\nWe will do a brief introduction and ask Maintainers and Mentors to introduce themselves.. Once we get started we will ask Mentors to hang out in specific topic breakout rooms (e.g., “git/GitHub”) for at least the first 5 min to see if any participants would like to chat. After that they are free to roam about the rooms, helping as they like. Maintainers can claim a breakout room to chat with participants wanting to work on their package or can move about among the rooms. Participants may need some time to get oriented with what tasks are available and how to start working on them. Remember that some participants may be raw beginners, so help them find an appropriate issue to tackle and be encouraging and patient. This will be a coworking session, so people can dive in with getting started but still have others around to help or answer questions.\nAfter the hackathon\nEveryone who participated in the hackathon will be added to a special Slack channel so conversations can continue asynchronously. We suspect that some participants may not finish all they hope to do during the coworking session itself, so we hope that both Maintainers and Mentors will have some availability to answer questions that may come up on the Slack channel in the week following the event (Yani and Steffi will be available too).

    "text": "In our pilot we had opened the call for mentors before setting a date. We then used a poll to decide on appropriate dates for the mini-hackathon. This made it difficult for mentors to commit to the event, as we were asking for expressions of interest before we had a date, so for future, generic events we suggest picking a date first.  However, if conducting domain-specific events, then it could be worth contacting mentor/maintainers first and then organizing the events in tandem with their schedules (similar to Community Calls).↩︎\nRegistration is required for mentor/maintainers as we need to ensure there are enough and we will be sending out further instructions.↩︎\nFor our first mini-hackathon, we required registration, but for the second we made registration optional. This helped us have an idea of numbers, but simplified the process as we didn’t have to send out meeting links or deal with last minute registrants.↩︎",

This will be on Zoom (details on the event page and below) and Yani and Steffi will be available to help out.\nBefore the hackathon\nAs a reminder, we ask that Maintainers take a bit of time before the event to create and/or label issues in your packages. Remember to use the “ro-hackathon-2025” label and let us know if you have any questions or need any help with this.\nDuring the hackathon\nWe will do a brief introduction and ask Maintainers and Mentors to introduce themselves.. Once we get started we will ask Mentors to hang out in specific topic breakout rooms (e.g., “git/GitHub”) for at least the first 5 min to see if any participants would like to chat. After that they are free to roam about the rooms, helping as they like. Maintainers can claim a breakout room to chat with participants wanting to work on their package or can move about among the rooms. Participants may need some time to get oriented with what tasks are available and how to start working on them. Remember that some participants may be raw beginners, so help them find an appropriate issue to tackle and be encouraging and patient. This will be a coworking session, so people can dive in with getting started but still have others around to help or answer questions.\nAfter the hackathon\nEveryone who participated in the hackathon will be added to a special Slack channel so conversations can continue asynchronously. We suspect that some participants may not finish all they hope to do during the coworking session itself, so we hope that both Maintainers and Mentors will have some availability to answer questions that may come up on the Slack channel in the week following the event (Yani and Steffi will be available too). Yani will also contact you regarding your stipend to help offset the costs of your time for this amazing work!\nWe’re looking forward to seeing you next week, let us know if you have any questions!\nYani Bellini Saibene\nCommunity Manager, rOpenSci\nSteffi LaZerte\nCommunity Manager Assistant\nZoom info:\nLink:\nMeeting ID:\nPasscode:",

We included a Quiet room where people could work without chatter, as well as several generic rooms (“Room 1”, etc.) where package maintainers can chat one-on-one or with small groups of participants about their package.\nAt the start of coworking an organizer asks mentors (those without a package), to go to a topic room and stay for 5min in case a participant would like help with that topic. Afterwards they are free to ‘roam’ and see where they might assist participants or maintainers.\nNext an organizer will ask participants if they have a particular package or issue they’d like to work on, and will help match participants up with maintainers if they are unsure. The organizer will assign maintainers to specific rooms to chat with participants as participants express interest.\nAfter this initial sorting, at least one organizer remains in the ‘main’ room to help direct participants.\n\n\nBreakout room topics\n\nGeneral (main room) ‘If you’re not sure, come here’\nCollaboration Workflows and Etiquette\nCollaborating on GitHub (Pull Requests)\nTranslations\nQuiet Room\nRoom 1\nRoom 2\n…\n\n\nIn our first mini-hackathons, we had one ‘Git and GitHub’ room rather than the two ‘Collaborating’ rooms, but it was almost never used.",
