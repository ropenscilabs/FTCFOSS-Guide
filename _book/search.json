    "text": "2.1 Background\nIn 2024/2025, rOpenSci piloted a new community event format for connecting new contributors to open-source scientific software and documentation translation. This event format involves pairing community calls and specialized coworking sessions with goal of guiding community members into first-time contributions to open source scientific software and translation projects through an inclusive and supportive learning experience.\nThis new format was an extension of our successful and established community call and coworking activities.\nrOpenSci Community Calls are 1-hour online events with 2-5 speakers, 1 moderator, and include 20-40 minutes of discussion/Q&A. These calls serve to strengthen connections between members of the rOpenSci community, teach technical and social topics, bring different stakeholders’ perspectives to light, and identify unmet needs on a topic. Video, transcripts, notes and summaries of all our calls are published. We have hosted 43 calls with XX unique presenters attended by more than xx people from xx countries.  We attract a global audience with representation from academia, government, non-profit, and industry. In the past year we have started holding these events in Spanish and Portuguese to expand global accessibility.\nWe introduced Coworking sessions in 2021. These sessions give our members the opportunity to cowork on open-source projects with common themes. Each session features a different Community Host with expertise in the theme, facilitated by rOpenSci staff.  At these events, participants meet other scientific software developers and experts, and ask questions and receive guidance as they work. After each session we publish shared notes and resources. To date, we have hosted XX sessions.",

    "text": "2.2 Pilot\n\nIn 2024/2025 we hosted two sets of paired events to suppport first time contributors to open source software. We used community calls to introduce the topics and hands-on coworking sessions to give opportunities for participation. This format is designed to be scalable across our federation of scientific OSS and will serve as a model for maintainers to replicate in recruiting contributors and co-maintainers.\nThe first set of events were designed to support first-time contributors to open source Translation projects, using rOpenSci’s Portugese translation projects as an example. To this end, in November 2025 we hosted a Portugese Community Call (A comunidade R fala português) followed by a mini-translathon at LatinR.\nThe second set of events were designed to support first-time contributors to open source R packages. In Januaray 2025 we hosted an English Community Call (From Novice to Contributor: Making and Supporting First-Time Contributions to FOSS), followed by two mini-hackathon coworking sessions in Februrary and March.\nIn this guide we share resources to help plan and host more of these events as well as lessons learned.\n\n2.2.1 Feedback\nAs part of each hands-on mini-hackathon or translation, participants completed an optional feedback survey collecting insights on their experiences, challenges faced, and suggestions for improvement.\nTODO: ADD GENERAL, summarized Feedback\n\n\n2.2.2 Takeaways\nIn addition to the official feedback provided, the organizers also picked up on some trends and details during the events.\nFor the translathons…\nFor the mini-hackathons, while we had originally expected to have many participants new to GitHub, in reality most participants were familiar with GitHub in general, but were unfamiliar with collaborating on GitHub. They knew how to make and push commits, but wanted to learn how to make Pull Requests and how that process worked. They were also interested in understanding the etiquette and workflow of making contributions.\nFurther, many participants were very familiar with coding in R (or other programming languages), but were not familiar with R package development (i.e. working with the package structure, using development tools, testing interactively, and using formal unit tests).\nIt took time for participants to decide on an issue, and there was the sense sometimes that they felt a bit rushed. If possible, it might therefore be nice to share the GitHub Issues Project Board with participatns before the start of coworking, so they have more time to explore the issues and think about what they would like to tackle.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "6.1 Overview\nMini-hackathons are 2-hr events designed as a variation on the standard rOpenSci coworking format. They are a combination of a hackathon (a dedicated period of time where participants make contributions to selected FOSS projects) and an rOpenSci coworking event (an online video meeting where participants come together to work on different things and socialize).\nrOpenSci Coworking Sessions are generally 2-hr sessions with a primary host and a guest community host with a different theme each month. During a session, the primary host orientates participants and leads introductions. Then participants can choose work on their own projects, to socialize or discuss the monthly theme in a ‘noisy’ breakout room with the community host, or a combination of the two. The primary host arranges a break and mini-scavenger hunt in the middle and wraps up the meeting at the end.\nMini-hackathons differ from coworking (and from many hackathons) in that it is presumed that most if not all participants are attending to contribute to FOSS (possibly for the first time), there are many breakout rooms, and there are at least 5-10 mentors or maintainers to support the participants.\nIn a mini-hackathon, rOpenSci staff, package maintainers, and mentors are on hand to support participants with their first contributions. Maintainers and mentors sign up to participate beforehand and prepare relevant issues for new contributors. During the coworking session, mentors and maintainers split into different Zoom breakout rooms to chat with participants one-on-one or in small groups to support them with their contributions. All maintainers, mentors, and participants are also added to a special mini-hackathon channel in the rOpenSci Slack where they can further discuss contributions after the event ends.",

    "section": "6.2 Maintainers / Mentors",
    "text": "6.2 Maintainers / Mentors\nThe goal of mini-hackathons is less that open source projects receive attention, and more that participants have a good experience from which they learn how to make contributions, and gain the confidence/motivation to continue making contributions. Therefore, the core idea of the mini-hackathon is that it is a live and synchronous event, and that there will be active and immediate support for participants.\nAs such it is important to ensure that sufficient maintainers and mentors are present. Maintainers are those who maintain an R package to which they will be supporting contributions. Mentors are those who are not expliciting supporting contributions to their own R package, but who will be generally helping participants learn how to make contributions to other packages.\n\nOriginally we solicited participation from maintainers of rOpenSci packages in particular, later however, we opened up registration to maintainers of any R package and mentors in general in order to increase the number of maintainers/mentors participating.\n\nBecause this work doesn’t necessarily directly benefit the maintainer/mentor and it may require extra work to prepare an R package for contributions of this nature, we suggest offering maintainers/mentors an honorarium to help equalize participation by offsetting the cost of their time. If you do, prepare clear instructions on how mentors can receive their honorarium after the event. Depending on how your organization works, you may wish to include links to optional invoice templates.\n\nIn our 2024/2025 pilot we applied for and received funding from NumFocus through an Small Development Grant which allowed us to offer maintainers/mentors a $200 USD honorarium for participating in the mini-hackathons.",

    "section": "6.4 Planning",
    "text": "6.4 Planning\n\n6.4.1 Choosing date/times\nPick dates for the events prior to advertising open calls for maintainers/mentors and participants. Make sure you give yourself enough time to recruit maintainers/mentors (~6-8 weeks) and to change the date if you feel that you may not have enough maintainers/mentors. Then once you have a good set of maintainers/mentors registered, start advertizing for general participants (~4-6 weeks).\nHowever, if conducting domain-specific events, then it could be worth contacting maintainers/mentors first and then picking dates with their schedules in mind (similar to how rOpenSci organizes Community Calls).\n\nIn our pilot we had opened the call for mentors before setting a date. We then used a poll to decide on appropriate dates for the mini-hackathon. This made it difficult for mentors to commit to the event, as we were asking for expressions of interest before we had a date.\n\nRegardless of how dates are set, if arranging several events, choose times which give a reasonable level of international coverage.\n\nIn our pilot, we had two events, and so chose European and Australian time zones to cover as much range as possible.\n\n\n\n6.4.2 Registration\nRegistration is required for maintainers/mentors as we need to ensure there we have enough to help, and we need a way of contacting them to send out further instructions.\nRegistration is optional for participants to encourage last minute attendance, while still giving us an idea of the level of interest in the event. This helps us ensure we have enough maintainers/mentors and makes it easier to send Slack invitations as we already have the emails of some participants. We also pre-populate the coworking documents with the names of maintainers/mentors as well as registered participants.\n\nIn our first mini-hackathon pilot we made registration mandatory for participants, but in the end we didn’t find it necessary, so for the second event we made registration optional.\n\nWe find that optional registration simplifies organizing the event as we dodn’t necessarily have to send out meeting links or deal with last minute registrants.\nHowever, by having mandatory registration you would have an even better idea of the number of participants to expect, so the trade offs may be worth it for your organization, or depending on the nature of your hackathon.\n\nWe used AirTable forms to collect registrations for maintainers/mentors as well as participants. However, any registration form system could work for this step (e.g., Google Forms, Zoom, etc.)\n\n\n\n6.4.3 Issues and Labelling\nAbout two weeks before the event we contact maintainers to remind them about the event and ask them to prepare and label issues in their repositories using a label specific to the event.\nThere are also other labels that are very useful, like ‘help wanted’ and ‘good first issue’. You can also encourage maintainers to consider different type of label according to the type of project.\n\nIn the 2025 mini-hackathons, we used ro-hackathon-2025 as the label and Slack channel name.\n\nWe also suggest that maintainers create certain types of issues for these events. We find that small, bite-sized, coding-related tasks are issues most likely to be tackled by participants.\nExamples include\n\nadding simple tests to improve code coverage\nadding checks to input arguments to existing functions\nfixing problems with best-practices\nupdating use of deprecated functions\nadding badges to READMEs\n\nWhile documentation is something that can be completed by first-time contributors, it doesn’t seem to be as attractive. Possibly because updating usage or creating tutorials requires more time to understand the package, or because it doesn’t give participants a chance to develop the skills they really want to develop.\n\n\n6.4.4 GitHub Project Board\nBy havinging maintainers use a specific label for issues, we can use a GitHub search to identify these issues.\nWe then also find it useful to manually organize these issues into a GitHub Project. This allows us to categorize the issues by type (Documentation, Feature, Best Practices, Testing, etc.) to help participants more quickly find an issue they would like to address. The links to the Project and the Search are added to the Coworking document as well as the Slack channel for easy access.\n\n\n6.4.5 Outreach and Communication\nWe advertise the calls for maintainers/mentors and participants with\n\nblog posts (e.g., mentors, participants)\nsocial media (e.g., LinkedIn and Mastodon; see example text),\nSlack channels (rOpenSci as well as on partnering Slack workspaces)\nrOpenSci Newsletter (e.g., mentors, participants).\n\nIn addition the these announcements, it’s important to send reminders 1 week, 1 day, and 1 hour in advance on social media (examples).",

We include a Quiet room where people can work without chatter, as well as several generic rooms (“Room 1”, etc.) where package maintainers can chat one-on-one or with small groups of participants about their package.\nAt the start of coworking an organizer asks mentors (those without a package), to go to a topic room and stay for 5 min in case a participant would like help with that topic. Afterwards they are free to ‘roam’ and see where they might assist participants or maintainers.\nNext an organizer will ask participants if they have a particular package or issue they’d like to work on, and will help match participants up with maintainers if they are unsure. The organizer will assign maintainers to specific rooms to chat with participants as participants express interest.\nAfter this initial sorting, at least one organizer remains in the ‘main’ room to help direct participants.\n\n\nBreakout room topics\n\nGeneral (main room) ‘If you’re not sure, come here’\nCollaboration Workflows and Etiquette\nCollaborating on GitHub (Pull Requests)\nTranslations\nQuiet Room\nRoom 1\nRoom 2\n…\n\n\nIn our pilot mini-hackathons, we had one ‘Git and GitHub’ room rather than the two ‘Collaborating’ rooms, but it was almost never used.",

    "text": "B.2 Mentors - 1 week before\nSubject: rOpenSci Mini Hackathon - Information\nHi Everyone!\nWe’re looking forward to our second Mini-hackathon coworking session next week, MONTH DAYth, HH:MM–HH:MM UTC (find your local time [UPDATE DATE/TIME]). This will be on Zoom (details on the event page [UPDATE LINK] and below) and Yani and Steffi will be available to help out.\nBefore the hackathon\nAs a reminder, we ask that Maintainers take a bit of time before the event to create and/or label issues in your packages. Remember to use the “ro-hackathon-2025” label and let us know if you have any questions or need any help with this.\nDuring the hackathon\nWe will do a brief introduction and ask Maintainers and Mentors to introduce themselves.. Once we get started we will ask Mentors to hang out in specific topic breakout rooms (e.g., “git/GitHub”) for at least the first 5 min to see if any participants would like to chat. After that they are free to roam about the rooms, helping as they like. Maintainers can claim a breakout room to chat with participants wanting to work on their package or can move about among the rooms. Participants may need some time to get oriented with what tasks are available and how to start working on them.

    "text": "B.1.1 Mentors - 2 weeks before\nSubject: rOpenSci Mini Hackathon - Preparation\nHi Everyone!\nWe’re looking forward to our second Mini-hackathon coworking session in two weeks, March 4th, 13:00–15:00 UTC (find your local time [UPDATE DATE/TIME]). Some of you have signed up as Package Maintainers, and some as Mentors to help guide participants during the hackathon. We’ll send out details of how things will go next week, but in the meantime we wanted to give Package Maintainers some suggestions for preparing.\nBefore the hackathon we ask that Maintainers take a bit of time to create and/or label issues in your packages. We find that small ‘bite-size’ tasks work well, and small coding-related tasks especially so.\nConsider issues for things like adding simple tests (e.g., testing that functions fail correctly), or adding argument checks to an existing function (e.g., ensure that the function fails informatively given incorrect inputs). You can run test coverage on your package to identify lines that need coverage which might be straightforward to address. Another thing that you can consider is addressing problems identified by ‘goodpractice’ (we’d suggest running this beforehand and creating specific issues for the items identified). Updating the README or clarifying the CONTRIBUTING guide are also useful, yet manageable tasks.\nMake sure you use the label “ro-hackathon-YYYY” so we can find it and add the issue to our master list. Also consider labels such as “help wanted” and “good first issue”. There may be participants who have more advanced skills so feel free to label some non-beginner issues as well.\nWe’ve created a channel called “ro-hackathon-YYYY” in the rOpenSci Slack and have added those of you who are already in this Slack. If you are not in our workspace, you will get an invitation from Yani nearer to the event.\nFeel free to advertise this event [UPDATE LINK] in your circles or social media!\nLet us know if you have any questions or would like any help or feedback on anything,\nYani Bellini Saibene\nCommunity Manager, rOpenSci\nSteffi LaZerte\nCommunity Manager Assistant\n\n\nB.1.2 Mentors - 1 week before\nSubject: rOpenSci Mini Hackathon - Information\nHi Everyone!\nWe’re looking forward to our second Mini-hackathon coworking session next week, MONTH DAYth, HH:MM–HH:MM UTC (find your local time [UPDATE DATE/TIME]). This will be on Zoom (details on the event page [UPDATE LINK] and below) and Yani and Steffi will be available to help out.\nBefore the hackathon\nAs a reminder, we ask that Maintainers take a bit of time before the event to create and/or label issues in your packages. Remember to use the “ro-hackathon-2025” label and let us know if you have any questions or need any help with this.\nDuring the hackathon\nWe will do a brief introduction and ask Maintainers and Mentors to introduce themselves.. Once we get started we will ask Mentors to hang out in specific topic breakout rooms (e.g., “git/GitHub”) for at least the first 5 min to see if any participants would like to chat. After that they are free to roam about the rooms, helping as they like. Maintainers can claim a breakout room to chat with participants wanting to work on their package or can move about among the rooms. Participants may need some time to get oriented with what tasks are available and how to start working on them. Remember that some participants may be raw beginners, so help them find an appropriate issue to tackle and be encouraging and patient. This will be a coworking session, so people can dive in with getting started but still have others around to help or answer questions.\nAfter the hackathon\nEveryone who participated in the hackathon will be added to a special Slack channel so conversations can continue asynchronously. We suspect that some participants may not finish all they hope to do during the coworking session itself, so we hope that both Maintainers and Mentors will have some availability to answer questions that may come up on the Slack channel in the week following the event (Yani and Steffi will be available too).
