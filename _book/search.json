    "text": "We piloted a new community event format for connecting new contributors to open-source scientific software and documentation translation, based on rOpenSci’s successful community call and coworking activities, and developed materials to replicate these events across software ecosystems. \nrOpenSci Community Calls are 1-hour online events with 2-5 speakers, 1 moderator, and include 20-40 minutes of discussion/Q&A. These calls serve to strengthen connections between members of the rOpenSci community, teach technical and social topics, bring different stakeholders’ perspectives to light, and identify unmet needs on a topic. Video, transcripts, notes and summaries of all our calls are published. We have hosted 43 calls with xx unique presenters attended by more than xx people from xx countries.  We attract a global audience with representation from academia, government, non-profit, and industry. In the past year we have started holding these events in Spanish and Portuguese to expand global accessibility.\nWe introduced Coworking sessions in 2021. These sessions give our members the opportunity to cowork on open-source projects with common themes. Each session features a different Community Host with expertise in the theme, facilitated by rOpenSci staff.  At these events, participants meet other scientific software developers and experts, and ask questions and receive guidance as they work. After each session we publish shared notes and resources. To date, we have hosted xx sessions. \nUsing our success hosting community calls and coworking sessions, we piloted a series of paired events with the goal of guiding community members into first-time contributions to open source scientific software and translation projects through an inclusive and supportive learning experience.  The model proposed is designed to be scalable across our federation of scientific OSS and will serve as a model for maintainers to replicate in recruiting contributors and co-maintainers. We used community calls to introduce the topics and hands-on coworking sessions to give opportunities to participate. To reduce barriers to participation and broaden the scope of involvement, we will host events in both English and Spanish. This series will kick off with an English community call on the topic of first-time contributions to open source software and introducing a set of packages from our federation seeking contributors. It will provide an overview of software package architecture, contributing guidelines, and outstanding issues. It will do so in a welcoming environment where authors and potential contributors can share experiences, address common questions, and provide esential resources. Attendees has the opportunity to ask questions and engage with new and experienced contributors in a supportive atmosphere. Following this community call will be special coworking sessions (mini hackathons), hosted by rOpenSci staff and package maintainers who will be on hand to support participants with their first contributions. Maintainers sign up to participate beforehand and prepare relevant issues for new contributors. As we expect the maintainers to go above simple package maintenance and to be supportive mentors and teachers, we will provide an honorarium. In this pilot we hosted two of these events as multilingual events in English and Spanish.\nA second set of events focus on contributing translations to documentation and message localization in open source projects.  As in the code contribution events, we pair a community call with coworking. The community call will provide guidance on how to get started with translation contributions. In the coworking events (translathons), participants work together on translating open source documentation and interfaces. These event was hosted in Portuguese and focus on Portuguese documentation translation. The event occured in conjunction with LatinR 2024.\nParticipants completed an optional feedback survey collecting insights on their experiences, challenges faced, and suggestions for improvement. We combine these results with our learned best practices into a these guide for software maintainers for running these events.",
