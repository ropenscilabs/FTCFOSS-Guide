title: "Mini-translathon"
---

## Overview

Traslatons are 2-hour events designed as a combination of translation (the communication of the meaning of a source-language text by means of an equivalent target-language text) with the ways and energy of a hackathon (a dedicated period of time where participants make contributions to selected FOSS projects).
During the mini-traslathon participants work together on translating open source documentation, website, blog post and interfaces into different human languages.
Traslathons are live and synchronous: participants contribute, learn, and connect with others.

rOpenSci staff prepare the event by identifying materials in need of translation or review, creating and labeling pull requests, and setting up a GitHub Project board to track progress.
During the event, after a brief introduction on how the event is structure, participants select a pull request to work on.
Mentors and editors provide real-time support in breakout rooms or the main room.
All contributors are also added to the multilingual channel in the rOpenSci Slack, where they can continue discussing and refining translations after the event.

Participants completed an optional feedback survey collecting insights on their experiences, challenges faced, and suggestions for improvement.

The community call provided guidance on how to get started with translation contributions and different translations and localization efforts that exist for a human language in the community.

## Mentors and Editors

The main goal is traslathon events is to ensure participants have a good experience:

-   learning how to contribute to translations,
-   gaining confidence in the process, and
-   building motivation to continue contributing beyond the event.

To achieve this, traslathons rely on two key roles:

-   **Mentors:** contributors familiar with the translation process, tools, and community guidelines.
    They help participants get started, troubleshoot issues, and guide them through the workflow.

-   **Editors:** experienced translators responsible for reviewing and maintaining the quality and consistency of translations.
    Editors check terminology, style, and adherence to the community’s translation agreements.

Mentors and Editors sign up to participate beforehand and review the [translation process and rules](https://translationguide.ropensci.org), and the translation that need contribution.
They are preferably people who have already contributed, as reviewers or editors, to rOpenSci's translations and know how the tools used in the process work and are also aware of the translation agreements of the language in which they are involved.

Because preparing and reviewing translations requires additional effort, we suggest offering mentors and editors an honorarium to recognize their time and contributions.

> In our 2024 pilot, the traslaton was hosted in Portuguese in conjunction with LatinR, where many members of the Latin American R community gathered.
> NumFocus provide the funding to pay mentors and editors a \$200 USD honorarium for participating in the traslathons.

## Timeline

See [Events Overview](events-overview.html) for the full timeline of paired 
events.

The timeline is setup for a single event, but repeat events are easy to insert
after the first three tasks.

## Planning

### Set the date of the event 

In our pilot case, the translathon was held as a satellite event of the LatinR conference. Therefore, the date depended on the availability of both the conference schedule and the mentors and editors. For future general events, we recommend choosing the date first and then inviting mentors and editors. For niche events (e.g., by language or subject area), it may be more effective to coordinate with editors and mentors first and then set the date, similar to the dynamics of Community Calls. If you plan to organize multiple events, it is essential to take time zones into account to facilitate global and diverse participation.

### Registration

Registration is required for **mentors/editors** so we can confirm sufficient support and send them preparation instructions.
For **participants**, registration can be optional, especially if the event is not part of a larger event. 

> In our pilot we registered attendees free of charge using the same conference registration system. This system was also used to send pre-event notifications and to share access information for the online meeting wich helps with the logistic of the event.
