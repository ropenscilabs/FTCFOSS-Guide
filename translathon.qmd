title: "Mini-translathon"

## Overview 

Mini traslathon are a combination of translation (the communication of the meaning of a source-language text by means of an equivalent target-language text) and a  hackathon (a dedicated period of time where participants make contributions to selected FOSS projects). During 2 hours participants work together on translating open source documentation and interfaces.

In a traslathon, rOpenSci Staff and mentors are on hand to support participants with their contribution. Mentors sign up to participate beforehand and review the [translation process and rules](https://translationguide.ropensci.org), and the translation that need contribution. Mentors are preferably people who have already contributed to translations and know how the tools used in the process work and are also aware of the translation agreements of the language in which they are involved. rOpenSci staff will create and label all the pull requests with translation that needs a review and update the GitHub project with the status of the translation and localization work. 

During the event, and after a brief introduction on how the process work, attendees will choose from the GitHub project which pull request they want to work on. Mentors will be there to support and overseeing the process. People work on the main room or in different breakout rooms. All mentors and contributors are added to the multilingual channel in the rOpenSci Slack where they can further discuss and work on contributions after the events ends. 

The community call provided guidance on how to get started with translation contributions and diferents translations and localization efforts that exist for a human language in the community.

> For our pilot these event were hosted in Portuguese and focus on Portuguese documentation translation. The event occured in conjunction with LatinR 2024, were many members of the R Community in Latin America gather together.

Participants completed an optional feedback survey collecting insights on their experiences, challenges faced, and suggestions for improvement.
