# Events Overview {#overview}

Here we have a rough overview of the projected timeline for running a set of events.
One set of events consists of a Community Call paired with 1-2 hands-on mini-hackathons or mini-translathons.

See the relevant chapter for specific details for organizing a specific event type.
